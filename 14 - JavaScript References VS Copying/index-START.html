    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = [...players];
    players[2] = "lux";
    console.log(team);
    console.log(players);
    const team2 = Array.from(players);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    const cap1 = person;
    cap1.number = 22;
    // Object.assign(empty, copy person, add own property)
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.height = 34;
    // Object.assign is shallow copy
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {numer:99});

    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {greeting: "hello", bye: "byebye"}
    }
    // Deepclone
    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

    const array = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]];
    const clone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(array));
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
